With an internship, I hope to be able to explore new and exciting  fields and get some valuable experience working with others in a professional setting. ',
				subnote: 'As for future learnings, I plan to build a tutoring webpage in order to help a family member with her tutoring business. This project will incorporate some backend development, database management, and better webpage designs using Figma. Moreover, the experience of trying to tailor a webpage/app to user needs would be an interesting experience for someone like me (someone who has primarly done projects for gaining experience). I will add this new project when I see it fit to include it on this webpage.',
