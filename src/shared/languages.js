			description: 'I would consider Java to be my strongest programming language, as I have 4 years of experience using it to program most of my school related projects (from the 11th grade onwards). I have programmed custom classes for all of the common sort of elementary Data Structures like linked lists and binary trees. I have limited experience with JFrame as well, as I programmed a poker game using Java for a project final in AP Computer Science A in my Junior Year of high school. ',

			description: 'I have moderate experience in C as I used it for my Computer Systems Organization Class during my spring semester of freshman year. In that class we were learning about the architecture of modern computers and we primarily focused on doing projects related to that. Yet, our first objective in the class was to gain a solid understanding of how C works (learned about pointers and Bitwise Operators) and how C differs from java. For our final project, we simulated L1, L2, L3, and Memory entirely in C and assembly in order to examine how memory is mapped between these levels.',

In that class I learned the fundamentals of the language (leaq/l vs movq/l, what registers are, callee vs caller registers, and other such pieces of information). While I haven’t used Assembly since that class in the spring of 2021, it shouldn’t take me too long to program applications using x86 Assembly depending on the task.',

While this project got me familiar with numpy and pandas, if I were tasked with programing anything outside of this sphere it would take me some time.',

This was done in the context of the MIT Inspire Completion that I submitted to in 9th and 10th grade. This being said, it has been some time since I last used this language and it would take some time for me to get back into it. I am sort of familiar with displaying spacial data and ggplot as I used these packages extensively when I was working with this language.',
