				description: 'The fact that R is a language may deter some users who think “I can’t program”. This should not be the case for two reasons. First, R is an interpreted language, not a compiled one, meaning that all commands typed on the keyboard are directly executed without requiring to build a complete program like in most computer languages (C, Fortran, Pascal, . . .). Second, R’s syntax is very simple and intuitive. For instance, a linear regression can be done with the command lm(y ~ x) which means “fitting a linear model with y as response and x as predictor”. In R, in order to be executed, a function always needs to be written with parentheses, even if there is nothing within them (e.g., ls()). If one just types the name of a function without parentheses, R will display the content of the function. In this document, the names of the functions are generally written with parentheses in order to distinguish them from other objects, unless the text indicates clearly so.',
