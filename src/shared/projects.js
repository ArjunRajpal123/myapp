My main objective was to design, implement, and deploy a simple web app in order to display my personal info (like an abridged resume of sorts) and to learn how to use React given the knowledge I had about React Native. If you are reading this, it is safe to say that I have accomplished both tasks. Technical Note/Summary: This page was built using React.js/JavaScript and it is hosted via GitHub pages.',

Currently it is published on the google play store but, it is not published on the apple app store because I didnâ€™t own a Mac at the time so I was not able to compile it for a Mac release. This project served as an important stepping stone into my current passion of web development and learning more about how the backend works. ',
